![TLV Viewer](logo.png)

**TLV Viewer** is a simple and clean web tool to parse and pretty-print TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoded data into readable JSON format.

## What is TLV?

TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoding is widely used in networking protocols, UPI (Unified Payments Interface), payment systems, and many communication protocols to structure data efficiently. It represents data as a sequence of triplets: 

- **Type/Tag** — identifies the data element  
- **Length** — specifies the length of the data  
- **Value** — the actual data content  

Parsing TLV manually can be tedious; this tool makes it easier to visualize and debug TLV payloads.
